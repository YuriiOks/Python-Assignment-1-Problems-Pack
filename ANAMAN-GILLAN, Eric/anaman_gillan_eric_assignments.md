# Assignment for ANAMAN-GILLAN, Eric

## Task 1

**Problem:** Write a program to sum the first `n` natural numbers. The result must be an integer.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 100 | 5050 |
| 2   | 15  | 120  |
| 3   | 99  | 4950 |


## Task 2
**Problem:** The university uses the following scale to interpret student test results: 
- `90` points and above (A), 
- `80-89` (B), 
- `70-79` (C), 
- `60-69` (D), 
- below `60` (F). 

Write a program that allows the student to enter the test score, and then display the grade for this score.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs             |
| --- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 1   | 95     | Your grade is A.    |
| 2   | 74     | Your grade is C.    |
| 3   | 60     | Your grade is D.    |



## Task 3

**Problem:** Given a `three-digit integer`. Determine the `sum of the first and last digits` of the number and `compare` it with the `value of the second digit` of the number. Accordingly, output the message: `>`, `<` and `=`.

### Input:
- An `integer` representing the three-digit number.

### Output:
- A `string` indicating the comparison result.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 122 | > |
| 2   | 121 | = |
| 3   | 263 | < |

### Note:
The problem tests the ability to work with digits of a number and compare their values.




## Task 4

**Problem:** Write a program where the user enters integers. If an integer `n` is entered, the program should end its execution with the message `Done`. First, the user enters the number `n`, and then the rest of the numbers. 

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 5<br>67<br>112<br>14<br>5 | Done |
| 2   | 3<br>1<br>2<br>3 | Done |
| 3   | 1<br>1 | Done |



## Task 5

**Problem:** High school students took part in a computer science quiz. They had to answer 20 questions. The winner of the quiz is the participant who correctly answered the most questions. How many questions did the winner answer correctly? If there are participants in the quiz who could not give a correct answer to any of the questions, print Yes, otherwise print No. It is guaranteed that there are participants who correctly answered at least one question. The program receives the number of quiz participants `n` (1 ‚â§ `n` ‚â§ 50) as input, then for each participant, the number of questions they answered correctly is entered.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 5<br>10<br>15<br>7<br>0<br>16 | 16<br>Yes |
| 2   | 3<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0 | 0<br>Yes |
| 3   | 4<br>20<br>20<br>20<br>20 | 20<br>No |
