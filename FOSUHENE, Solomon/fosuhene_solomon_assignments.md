# Assignment for FOSUHENE, Solomon

## Task 1
**Problem:** A natural number is given. Find the digit that stands in the tens place in the decimal notation of the number (the second digit, counting from the end of the record).
 

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 1981   | 8       |
| 2   | 158    | 5       |
| 3   | 5      | 0       |

## Task 2
**Problem:** Convert a decimal number within 1 to 10 into its Roman numeral equivalent.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 8      | VIII    |
| 2   | 10     | X       |
| 3   | 4      | IV      |



## Task 3

**Problem:**Write a program where the user enters the value of the current date: day, month, and year (whole numbers), and the program outputs the `previous day's date` in the format: `dd.mm.yyyy`.

### Input:
- Three `integers` representing the day, month, and year.

### Output:
- A `string` representing the previous day's date in the format `dd.mm.yyyy`.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 1<br>3<br>2024 | 29.2.2024 |
| 2   | 1<br>1<br>2020 | 31.12.2019 |
| 3   | 2<br>1<br>2020 | 1.1.2020 |


### Note:

The problem tests the ability to work with dates and calendar calculations.



## Task 4

**Problem:** Write a program to calculate the sum of all three-digit numbers that are divisible by `n`, where `n` is an integer entered by the user.

### Input:
- An integer representing the number `n`.

### Output:
- An integer representing the sum of all three-digit numbers that are divisible by `n`.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 125    | 3500 |
| 2   | 440    | 1320 |
| 3   | 600    | 600 |
| 4   | 1000   | 0 |

### Note:

The problem tests the ability to use loops and conditional statements to calculate the sum of a sequence of numbers.




## Task 5

**Problem:** A surveillance camera automatically registers the speed of passing cars, rounding the speed values to integers. It is necessary to determine the average registered speed of all cars. If the speed of at least one car was more than 60 km/h, print Yes, otherwise print No. The program receives the number of registered cars `n` (1 ‚â§ `n` ‚â§ 30) as input, then the speeds of the cars are indicated. The speed value cannot be less than 1 and more than 300. The program should first print the average speed with an accuracy of one decimal place, then Yes or No.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 3<br>50<br>45<br>65 | 53.3<br>Yes |
| 2   | 2<br>100<br>200 | 150.0<br>Yes |
| 3   | 1<br>30 | 30.0<br>No |
