# Assignment for BEUGRE, Corneille

## Task 1

**Problem:** Read two integers `a` and `b`, and print the maximum value between them. Use only integer arithmetic operations; branching, loops, or functions cannot be used.

### Input:
- Two integers `a` and `b`.

### Output:
- The maximum value between `a` and `b`.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 8<br>5 | 8       |
| 2   | 5<br>3 | 5       |
| 3   | 7<br>9 | 9       |


## Task 2

**Problem:** Write a program that asks the user to enter a person's age (an integer). The program should output a message about whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult according to the following rules: 
- if the person is `1` year old or less, he or she is an infant, 
- if the person is older than `1` year but younger than `13` years, they are a child, 
- if the person is not younger than `13` years but younger than `20` years, they are a teenager 
- and if the person is older than `20` years, they are an adult.

### Input:
- An integer representing the age of the person.

### Output:
- A string message indicating the age group of the person.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs               |
| --- | ------ | --------------------- |
| 1   | 3      | You are a child.      |
| 2   | 14     | You are a teenager.   |
| 3   | 25     | You are an adult.     |

### Note:
The problem tests the ability to use conditional statements to classify an input into one of several categories.



## Task 3
**Problem:** Given a three-digit integer. Determine the number of identical digits in the number record and output the value of this quantity.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 123    | 0       |
| 2   | 111    | 3       |
| 3   | 121    | 2       |
| 4   | 100    | 1       |



## Task 4

**Problem:** Write a program that counts the positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros entered by the user, and outputs their quantity in one line with one space between them.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs                      |
| --- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | 5<br>12<br>-45<br>0<br>14<br>0 | 2 1 2 |
| 2   | 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6 | 6 0 0 |
| 3   | -1<br>-2<br>-3<br>-4<br>-5<br>-6 | 0 6 0 |


## Task 5

**Problem:** Determine the sum of all elements of the sequence that ends with the number `0`. A sequence of integers that ends with the number `0` is entered (the number `0` itself is not included in the sequence, but is used as a sign of its end).

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 2<br>5<br>3<br>0 | 10 |
| 2   | 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>0 | 15 |
| 3   | 0 | 0 |
