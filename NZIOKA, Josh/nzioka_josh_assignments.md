# Assignment for NZIOKA, Josh

## Task 1

**Problem:** Determine if the number `a` is divisible by `b` without a remainder using only arithmetic operations. Branching, loops, and functions are prohibited. Output "YES" if divisible, otherwise "NO".

### Input:
- Two integers `a` and `b`.

### Output:
- "YES" if `a` is divisible by `b`, otherwise "NO".

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 10<br>2| YES     |
| 2   | 5<br>3 | NO      |
| 3   | 15<br>5| YES     |

### Note:
Tests the application of arithmetic and boolean algeebra operations to solve divisibility.


## Task 2
**Problem:** Several workers work at the car repair station. If any worker works more than `40` hours a week, he receives `1.5` times more than the usual hourly pay. Develop a program that calculates the employee's salary, including payment for extra hours. The program receives two integers - the number of working hours and the hourly rate.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs     |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1   | 45     | 712.5       |
| 2   | 35     | 560.0       |
| 3   | 50     | 875.0       |



## Task 3
**Problem:** Given a `four-digit number`. Check if it is a `palindrome`. A palindrome is a number, word, or text that reads the same left to right and right to left. For example, in our case, palindrome numbers will be: `1221`, `4444`, `9119`, etc.

### Input:
- An `integer` representing the four-digit number.

### Output:
- A `boolean` indicating whether the number is a palindrome.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 4556 | False |
| 2   | 8118 | True |
| 3   | 1221 | True |

### Note:
The problem tests the ability to `work with digits` of a number and `compare` their values.



## Task 4

**Problem:** Write a program to print a table of equivalence between mass in pounds and mass in kilograms for the values of `n` pounds (1 pound = 453 grams) in the form of a table.

### Input:
- An integer representing the number of pounds.

### Output:
- A table of equivalence between mass in pounds and mass in kilograms for the values of `n` pounds.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 5      | 1 0.45<br>2 0.91<br>3 1.36<br>4 1.81<br>5 2.27 |
| 2   | 3      | 1 0.45<br>2 0.91<br>3 1.36 |
| 3   | 7      | 1 0.45<br>2 0.91<br>3 1.36<br>4 1.81<br>5 2.27<br>6 2.72<br>7 3.18 |

### Note:

The problem tests the ability to use loops and conditional statements to print a table of values.




## Task 5

**Problem:** Write a program to determine the number of even elements in a sequence that ends with the number `0`. The number `0` is not included in the sequence, but is used as a sign of its end.

### Input:

- A sequence of integers that ends with the number `0`.

### Output:

- An integer representing the number of even elements in the sequence.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 3<br>6<br>9<br>8<br>0 | 2 |
| 2 | 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>0 | 2 |
| 3 | 10<br>20<br>30<br>40<br>50<br>0 | 5 |

### Note:

The problem tests the ability to use loops and conditional statements to count the number of occurrences of a specific value.
