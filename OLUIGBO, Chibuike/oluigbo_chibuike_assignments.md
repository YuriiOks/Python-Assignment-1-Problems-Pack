# Assignment for OLUIGBO, Chibuike

## Task 1

**Problem:** Write a program to calculate the sum of digits in a 4-digit integer entered by the user.

### Input:
- A 4-digit integer.

### Output:
- The sum of the digits of the given integer.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 4273   | 16      |
| 2   | 1221   | 6       |
| 3   | 3355   | 16      |

## Task 2

**Problem:** Tatiana loves to ride public transport, and when she gets a ticket, she immediately checks if it is `lucky`. A ticket is considered lucky if the `sum of the first three digits` matches the `sum of the last three digits` of the ticket number. Write a program that will check the equality of sums and output `Happy` if the sums match, and `Ordinary` if the sums are different. The program is given a string of `six digits`.

### Input:
- A `string` of six digits representing the ticket number.

### Output:
- A `string` that is either `Happy` if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits, or `Ordinary` if the sums are different.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 156012 | Ordinary |
| 2   | 122005 | Happy |
| 3   | 045090 | Happy |

### Note:
The problem tests the ability to work with digits of a number and compare their values.



## Task 3

**Problem:**Write a program where the user enters the value of the current date: day, month, and year (whole numbers), and the program outputs the `previous day's date` in the format: `dd.mm.yyyy`.

### Input:
- Three `integers` representing the day, month, and year.

### Output:
- A `string` representing the previous day's date in the format `dd.mm.yyyy`.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 1<br>3<br>2024 | 29.2.2024 |
| 2   | 1<br>1<br>2020 | 31.12.2019 |
| 3   | 2<br>1<br>2020 | 1.1.2020 |


### Note:

The problem tests the ability to work with dates and calendar calculations.



## Task 4

**Problem:** Write a program to print all even numbers from `1` to `n` in a single row separated by a space. Use the `continue` statement to skip odd numbers.

### Input:
- An integer representing the upper limit of the range.

### Output:
- A sequence of even numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive, separated by a space.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 10     | 2 4 6 8 10 |
| 2   | 7      | 2 4 6 |
| 3   | 20     | 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 |

### Note:
The problem tests the ability to work with digits of a number.



## Task 5

**Problem:** Write a program to calculate the sum of the factorials of all integers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

### Input:

- An integer representing the upper limit of the range.

### Output:

- An integer representing the sum of the factorials of all integers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 3 | 9 |
| 2 | 4 | 33 |
| 3 | 5 | 153 |

### Note:

The problem tests the ability to use loops and conditional statements to calculate the sum of a series.
